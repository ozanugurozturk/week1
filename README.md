# Project Name

Food ordering app that allows users to enter their choices and get information with browser pop-up. It offers discount to the under 18 people and asks confirmation in the end.

## The problem

I knew that I need to use functions to use loop to achieve my goal in this project. I checked and searched my previous works and online examples to apply. I planned to write the code with different examples to explore what I can do with JavaScript. I easily carried stored information according to the users answers via using functions. I used VSCODE and its' liveserver to check if I am doing correctly. I also tried the Technigo example many times.
